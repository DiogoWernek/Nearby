# Nearby

Nearby is a local discovery app created during RocketSeat's NLW (Next Level Week) programming event. This app allows users to easily explore nearby places, including restaurants, cinemas, shopping centers, hotels, bakeries, and more. Users can filter locations by category to find exactly what they're looking for, and view detailed profiles of each place.

Key features include:

• Local place discovery (restaurants, cinemas, shopping, hotels, bakeries, etc.)
• Category-based filtering for easy navigation
• Interactive map to locate nearby places
• User-friendly interface with detailed location information

This project was built using modern web technologies, providing a responsive and smooth user experience.
